This library is a plugin for [Cofoundry](https://www.cofoundry.org). For more information on getting started with Cofoundry check out the [Cofoundry repository](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry).

## Overview

Cofoundry does not have a default image resizing implementation and relies on plugins to add this functionality. For more info on image resizing in Cofoundry check out the [imaging documentation](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/wiki/Images). 

This plugin uses the popular [ImageResizer](https://imageresizing.net/) package to resize images dynamically.

The services register themselves automatically so no other configuration is required.
